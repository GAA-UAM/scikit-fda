=======

C and Cython routines for functional data analysis using the square root
slope framework and curves using the square root velocity framework
which performs pair-wise and group-wise alignment as well as modelling
using functional component analysis and regression.

The code has been extracted from the repositories `fdasrsf_python
<https://github.com/jdtuck/fdasrsf_python>`_ and `ElasticFDA.jl
<https://github.com/jdtuck/ElasticFDA.jl>`_ developed by J. Derek Tucker.
