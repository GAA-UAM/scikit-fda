Dimensionality Reduction
========================

When dealing with data samples with high dimensionality, we often need to
reduce the dimensions so we can better observe the data.

Variable selection
------------------
One approach to reduce the dimensionality of the data is to select a subset of
the original variables or features. This approach is called variable
selection. In FDA, this means evaluating the function at a small number of
points. These evaluations would be the selected features of the functional
datum.

The variable selection transformers implemented in scikit-fda are the
following:

Feature extraction
------------------
Other dimensionality reduction methods construct new features from
existing ones. For example, in functional principal component
analysis, we project the data samples into a smaller sample of
functions that preserve most of the original
variance.
