Smoothing
=========

Sometimes the functional observations are noisy. The noise can be reduced
by smoothing the data.

Kernel smoothers
----------------

Kernel smoothing methods compute the smoothed value at a point by considering
the influence of each input point over it. For doing this, it considers a
kernel function placed at the desired point. The influence of each input point
will be related with the value of the kernel function at that input point.

There are several kernel smoothers provided in this library. All of them are
also *linear* smoothers, meaning that they compute a smoothing matrix (or hat
matrix) that performs the smoothing as a linear transformation.

All of the smoothers follow the API of an scikit-learn transformer object.

The degree of smoothing is controlled in all smoother by an 
*smoothing parameter*, named ``smoothing_parameter``, that has different
meaning for each smoother.

Validation
----------

It is necessary to measure how good is the smoothing to prevent
*undersmoothing* and *oversmoothing*. The following classes follow the
scikit-learn API for a scorer object, and measure how good is the smoothing.
In both of them, the target object ``y`` should also be the original data.
These scorers need that the smoother is linear, as they use internally the
hat matrix.

The 
:class:`~skfda.preprocessing.smoothing.validation.LinearSmootherGeneralizedCVScorer` 
object accepts also an optional penalization_function, used instead of the 
default one. The available ones are:

   skfda.preprocessing.smoothing.validation.finite_prediction_error
   skfda.preprocessing.smoothing.validation.shibata
   skfda.preprocessing.smoothing.validation.rice
   
An utility class is also provided, which inherits from the sckit-learn class 
:class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`
and performs a grid search using the scorers to find the best
``smoothing_parameter`` from a list.
