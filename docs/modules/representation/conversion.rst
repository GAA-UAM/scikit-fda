Conversion between representations
==================================

This module contains classes (converters) for converting between different
representations. Currently only the conversion between :class:`FDataIrregular`
and :class:`FDataBasis` has been implemented via converters.

----------------------------------------------

These are the submodules that contain the converters for the conversion between
:class:`FDataIrregular` and :class:`FDataBasis`:
