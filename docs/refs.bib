  abstract = {In 2002, the UCR time series classification archive was first released with sixteen datasets. It gradually expanded, until 2015 when it increased in size from 45 datasets to 85 datasets. In October 2018 more datasets were added, bringing the total to 128. The new archive contains a wide range of problems, including variable length series, but it still only contains univariate time series classification problems. One of the motivations for introducing the archive was to encourage researchers to perform a more rigorous evaluation of newly proposed time series classification (TSC) algorithms. It has worked: most recent research into TSC uses all 85 datasets to evaluate algorithmic advances. Research into multivariate time series classification, where more than one series are associated with each class label, is in a position where univariate TSC research was a decade ago. Algorithms are evaluated using very few datasets and claims of improvement are not based on statistical comparisons. We aim to address this problem by forming the first iteration of the MTSC archive, to be hosted at the website www.timeseriesclassification.com. Like the univariate archive, this formulation was a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University of California, Riverside (UCR). The 2018 vintage consists of 30 datasets with a wide range of cases, dimensions and series lengths. For this first iteration of the archive we format all data to be of equal length, include no series with missing data and provide train/test splits.},

  abstract = {The use of variable selection methods is particularly appealing in statistical problems with functional data. The obvious general criterion for variable selection is to choose the `most representative' or `most relevant' variables. However, it is also clear that a purely relevance-oriented criterion could lead to select many redundant variables. The minimum Redundance Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, proposed by Ding and Peng [Minimum redundancy feature selection from microarray gene expression data. J Bioinform Comput Biol. 2005;3:185\textendash 205] and Peng et al. [Feature selection based on mutual information: criteria of max-dependency, max-relevance, and min-redundancy. IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell. 2005;27:1226\textendash 1238] is an algorithm to systematically perform variable selection, achieving a reasonable trade-off between relevance and redundancy. In its original form, this procedure is based on the use of the so-called mutual information criterion to assess relevance and redundancy. Keeping the focus on functional data problems, we propose here a modified version of the mRMR method, obtained by replacing the mutual information by the new association measure (called distance correlation) suggested by Sz\'ekely et al. [Measuring and testing dependence by correlation of distances. Ann Statist. 2007;35:2769\textendash 2794]. We have also performed an extensive simulation study, including 1600 functional experiments (100 functional models \texttimes 4 sample sizes \texttimes 4 classifiers) and three real-data examples aimed at comparing the different versions of the mRMR methodology. The results are quite conclusive in favour of the new proposed alternative.},

Unlike the case of finite-dimensional Gaussian measures, there are nontrivial examples of both situations when dealing with Gaussian stochastic processes. This article provides: (a) Explicit expressions for the optimal (Bayes) rule and the minimal classification error probability in several relevant problems of supervised binary classification of mutually absolutely continuous Gaussian processes. The approach relies on some classical results in the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). (b) An interpretation, in terms of mutual singularity, for the so-called ``near perfect classification'' phenomenon. We show that the asymptotically optimal rule proposed by these authors can be identified with the sequence of optimal rules for an approximating sequence of classification problems in the absolutely continuous case. (c) As an application, we discuss a natural variable selection method, which essentially consists of taking the original functional data X(t), t {$\in$} [0, 1] to a d-dimensional marginal (X(t1), \ldots, X(td)), which is chosen to minimize the classification error of the corresponding Fisher's linear rule. We give precise conditions under which this discrimination method achieves the minimal classification error of the original functional problem.

  abstract = {Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool in multivariate analysis. We suggest here an extension of this concept to the case of functional data. More precisely, the proposed definition concerns those statistical problems where the sample data are real functions defined on a compact interval of the real line. The obvious difficulty for such a functional extension is the non-invertibility of the covariance operator in infinite-dimensional cases. Unlike other recent proposals, our definition is suggested and motivated in terms of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) associated with the stochastic process that generates the data. The proposed distance is a true metric; it depends on a unique real smoothing parameter which is fully motivated in RKHS terms. Moreover, it shares some properties of its finite dimensional counterpart: it is invariant under isometries, it can be consistently estimated from the data and its sampling distribution is known under Gaussian models. An empirical study for two statistical applications, outliers detection and binary classification, is included. The results are quite competitive when compared to other recent proposals in the literature.},

However, some important technical issues appear (or are aggravated with respect to those of the multivariate case) due to the functional nature of the explanatory variable. First, the mere definition of the model can be questioned: While most approaches so far proposed rely on the \$\$L\^2\$\$-based model, we explore an alternative (in some sense, more general) approach, based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The validity conditions of such RKHS-based model, and their relation with the \$\$L\^2\$\$-based one, are investigated and made explicit in two formal results. Some relevant particular cases are considered as well. Second, we show that, under very general conditions, the maximum likelihood of the logistic model parameters fails to exist in the functional case, although some restricted versions can be considered. Third, we check (in the framework of binary classification) the practical performance of some RKHS-based procedures, well-suited to our model: They are compared to several competing methods via Monte Carlo experiments and the analysis of real data sets.},

First, we consider the situation where the prior probabilities of the competing populations are all equal and investigate classifiers that assign an observation to the population with respect to which it has the maximum location depth. We propose a different depth-based classification technique for unequal prior problems, which is also useful for equal prior cases, especially when the populations have different scatters and shapes. We use some simulated data sets as well as some benchmark real examples to evaluate the performance of these depth-based classifiers. Large sample behaviour of the misclassification rates of these depth-based non-parametric classifiers have been derived under appropriate regularity conditions.},

In cases such as these it is natural, efficient and sometimes essential to impose a spatial smoothness constraint on the coefficients, both for improved prediction performance and interpretability. We cast the classification problem into a regression framework via optimal scoring. Using this, our proposal facilitates the use of any penalized regression technique in the classification setting.

  abstract = {Using the DD-plot (depth vs. depth plot), we introduce a new nonparametric classification algorithm and call it DD-classifier. The algorithm is completely nonparametric, and it requires no prior knowledge of the underlying distributions or the form of the separating curve. Thus, it can be applied to a wide range of classification problems. The algorithm is completely data driven and its classification outcome can be easily visualized in a two-dimensional plot regardless of the dimension of the data. Moreover, it has the advantage of bypassing the estimation of underlying parameters such as means and scales, which is often required by the existing classification procedures. We study the asymptotic properties of the DD-classifier and its misclassification rate. Specifically, we show that DD-classifier is asymptotically equivalent to the Bayes rule under suitable conditions, and it can achieve Bayes error for a family broader than elliptical distributions. The performance of the classifier is also examined using simulated and real datasets. Overall, the DD-classifier performs well across a broad range of settings, and compares favorably with existing classifiers. It can also be robust against outliers or contamination.},

  abstract = {The abundance of functional observations in scientific endeavors has led to a significant development in tools for functional data analysis (FDA). This kind of data comes with several challenges: infinite-dimensionality of function spaces, observation noise, and so on. However, there is another interesting phenomena that creates problems in FDA. The functional data often comes with lateral displacements/deformations in curves, a phenomenon which is different from the height or amplitude variability and is termed phase variation. The presence of phase variability artificially often inflates data variance, blurs underlying data structures, and distorts principal components. While the separation and/or removal of phase from amplitude data is desirable, this is a difficult problem. In particular, a commonly used alignment procedure, based on minimizing the \$\textbackslash mathbb\{L\}\^\{2\}\$ norm between functions, does not provide satisfactory results. In this paper we motivate the importance of dealing with the phase variability and summarize several current ideas for separating phase and amplitude components. These approaches differ in the following: (1) the definition and mathematical representation of phase variability, (2) the objective functions that are used in functional data alignment, and (3) the algorithmic tools for solving estimation/optimization problems. We use simple examples to illustrate various approaches and to provide useful contrast between them.},

  abstract = {The mechanism by which inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) reduces cell death in ischemic-reperfused myocardium remains controversial. This study investigated whether cariporide could inhibit mitochondrial NHE during ischemia, delaying H+ gradient dissipation and ATP exhaustion. Mouse cardiac myocytes (HL-1) were submitted to 1 h of simulated ischemia (SI) with NaCN/deoxyglucose (pH 6.4), with or without 7 microM cariporide, and mitochondrial concentration of Ca2+ (Rhod-2), 2', 7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and the charge difference across the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim, JC-1) were assessed. ATP content was measured by bioluminescence and mitochondrial swelling by spectrophotometry in isolated mitochondria. Cariporide significantly attenuated the acidification of the mitochondrial matrix induced by SI without modifying Deltapsim decay, and this effect was associated to a delayed ATP exhaustion and increased mitochondrial Ca2+ load. These effects were reproduced in sarcolemma-permeabilized cells exposed to SI. In these cells, cariporide markedly attenuated the fall in mitochondrial pH induced by removal of Na+ from the medium. In isolated mitochondria, cariporide significantly reduced the rate and magnitude of passive matrix swelling induced by Na+ acetate. In isolated rat hearts submitted to 40-min ischemia at different temperatures (35.5 degrees, 37 degrees, or 38.5 degrees C) pretreatment with cariporide limited ATP depletion during the first 10 min of ischemia and cell death (lactate dehydrogenase release) during reperfusion. These effects were mimicked when a similar ATP preservation was achieved by hypothermia and were abolished when the sparing effect of cariporide on ATP was suppressed by hyperthermia. We conclude that cariporide acts at the mitochondrial level, delaying mitochondrial matrix acidification and delaying ATP exhaustion during ischemia. These effects can contribute to reduce cell death secondary to ischemia-reperfusion.},

This provides a more systematic basis for selection of a depth function. In particular, from these and other considerations it is found that the halfspace depth behaves very well overall in comparison with various competitors.},

This framework uses the Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric to derive a proper distance on the quotient space of functions modulo the time-warping group. A convenient square-root velocity function (SRVF) representation transforms the Fisher-Rao metric into the standard \$\textbackslash ltwo\$ metric, simplifying the computations. This distance is then used to define a Karcher mean template and warp the individual functions to align them with the Karcher mean template. The strength of this framework is demonstrated by deriving a consistent estimator of a signal observed under random warping, scaling, and vertical translation. These ideas are demonstrated using both simulated and real data from different application domains: the Berkeley growth study, handwritten signature curves, neuroscience spike trains, and gene expression signals. The proposed method is empirically shown to be be superior in performance to several recently published methods for functional alignment.},

In addition, outliers can be detected in a functional boxplot by the 1.5 times the 50\% central region empirical rule, analogous to the rule for classical boxplots. The construction of a functional boxplot is illustrated on a series of sea surface temperatures related to the El Ni\~no phenomenon and its outlier detection performance is explored by simulations. As applications, the functional boxplot and enhanced functional boxplot are demonstrated on children growth data and spatio-temporal U.S. precipitation data for nine climatic regions, respectively.

Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment covariance and correlation, but generalize and extend these classical bivariate measures of dependence. Distance correlation characterizes independence: it is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. The notion of covariance with respect to a stochastic process is introduced, and it is shown that population distance covariance coincides with the covariance with respect to Brownian motion; thus, both can be called Brownian distance covariance. In the bivariate case, Brownian covariance is the natural extension of product-moment covariance, as we obtain Pearson product-moment covariance by replacing the Brownian motion in the definition with identity. The corresponding statistic has an elegantly simple computing formula. Advantages of applying Brownian covariance and correlation vs the classical Pearson covariance and correlation are discussed and illustrated.},
