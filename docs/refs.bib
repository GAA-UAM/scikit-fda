  abstract = {The use of variable selection methods is particularly appealing in statistical problems with functional data. The obvious general criterion for variable selection is to choose the `most representative' or `most relevant' variables. However, it is also clear that a purely relevance-oriented criterion could lead to select many redundant variables. The minimum Redundance Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, proposed by Ding and Peng [Minimum redundancy feature selection from microarray gene expression data. J Bioinform Comput Biol. 2005;3:185\textendash 205] and Peng et al. [Feature selection based on mutual information: criteria of max-dependency, max-relevance, and min-redundancy. IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell. 2005;27:1226\textendash 1238] is an algorithm to systematically perform variable selection, achieving a reasonable trade-off between relevance and redundancy. In its original form, this procedure is based on the use of the so-called mutual information criterion to assess relevance and redundancy. Keeping the focus on functional data problems, we propose here a modified version of the mRMR method, obtained by replacing the mutual information by the new association measure (called distance correlation) suggested by Sz\'ekely et al. [Measuring and testing dependence by correlation of distances. Ann Statist. 2007;35:2769\textendash 2794]. We have also performed an extensive simulation study, including 1600 functional experiments (100 functional models \texttimes 4 sample sizes \texttimes 4 classifiers) and three real-data examples aimed at comparing the different versions of the mRMR methodology. The results are quite conclusive in favour of the new proposed alternative.},

  abstract = {The main ideas behind the classical multivariate logistic regression model make sense when translated to the functional setting, where the explanatory variable \$X\$ is a function and the response \$Y\$ is binary. However, some important technical issues appear (or are aggravated with respect to those of the multivariate case) due to the functional nature of the explanatory variable. First, the mere definition of the model can be questioned: while most approaches so far proposed rely on the \$L\_2\$-based model, we suggest an alternative (in some sense, more general) approach, based on the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). The validity conditions of such RKHS-based model, as well as its relation with the \$L\_2\$-based one are investigated and made explicit in two formal results. Some relevant particular cases are considered as well. Second we show that, under very general conditions, the maximum likelihood (ML) of the logistic model parameters fail to exist in the functional case. Third, on a more positive side, we suggest an RKHS-based restricted version of the ML estimator. This is a methodological paper, aimed at a better understanding of the functional logistic model, rather than focusing on numerical and practical issues.},

  abstract = {The abundance of functional observations in scientific endeavors has led to a significant development in tools for functional data analysis (FDA). This kind of data comes with several challenges: infinite-dimensionality of function spaces, observation noise, and so on. However, there is another interesting phenomena that creates problems in FDA. The functional data often comes with lateral displacements/deformations in curves, a phenomenon which is different from the height or amplitude variability and is termed phase variation. The presence of phase variability artificially often inflates data variance, blurs underlying data structures, and distorts principal components. While the separation and/or removal of phase from amplitude data is desirable, this is a difficult problem. In particular, a commonly used alignment procedure, based on minimizing the 핃2 norm between functions, does not provide satisfactory results. In this paper we motivate the importance of dealing with the phase variability and summarize several current ideas for separating phase and amplitude components. These approaches differ in the following: (1) the definition and mathematical representation of phase variability, (2) the objective functions that are used in functional data alignment, and (3) the algorithmic tools for solving estimation/optimization problems. We use simple examples to illustrate various approaches and to provide useful contrast between them.}

  abstract = {The mechanism by which inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) reduces cell death in ischemic-reperfused myocardium remains controversial. This study investigated whether cariporide could inhibit mitochondrial NHE during ischemia, delaying H+ gradient dissipation and ATP exhaustion. Mouse cardiac myocytes (HL-1) were submitted to 1 h of simulated ischemia (SI) with NaCN/deoxyglucose (pH 6.4), with or without 7 microM cariporide, and mitochondrial concentration of Ca2+ (Rhod-2), 2', 7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and the charge difference across the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim, JC-1) were assessed. ATP content was measured by bioluminescence and mitochondrial swelling by spectrophotometry in isolated mitochondria. Cariporide significantly attenuated the acidification of the mitochondrial matrix induced by SI without modifying Deltapsim decay, and this effect was associated to a delayed ATP exhaustion and increased mitochondrial Ca2+ load. These effects were reproduced in sarcolemma-permeabilized cells exposed to SI. In these cells, cariporide markedly attenuated the fall in mitochondrial pH induced by removal of Na+ from the medium. In isolated mitochondria, cariporide significantly reduced the rate and magnitude of passive matrix swelling induced by Na+ acetate. In isolated rat hearts submitted to 40-min ischemia at different temperatures (35.5 degrees, 37 degrees, or 38.5 degrees C) pretreatment with cariporide limited ATP depletion during the first 10 min of ischemia and cell death (lactate dehydrogenase release) during reperfusion. These effects were mimicked when a similar ATP preservation was achieved by hypothermia and were abolished when the sparing effect of cariporide on ATP was suppressed by hyperthermia. We conclude that cariporide acts at the mitochondrial level, delaying mitochondrial matrix acidification and delaying ATP exhaustion during ischemia. These effects can contribute to reduce cell death secondary to ischemia-reperfusion.},
