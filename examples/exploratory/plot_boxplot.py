# First, the Canadian Weather dataset is downloaded from the package 'fda' in
# CRAN. It contains a FDataGrid with daily temperatures and precipitations,
# that is, it has a 2-dimensional image. We are interested only in the daily
# average temperatures, so we will use the first coordinate.
X, y = datasets.fetch_weather(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
fd = X.iloc[:, 0].values
fd_temperatures = fd.coordinates[0]

##############################################################################
# The data is plotted to show the curves we are working with. They are divided
# according to the target. In this case, it includes the different climates to
# which the weather stations belong to.

# Each climate is assigned a color. Defaults to grey.
colormap = matplotlib.colormaps['seismic']
label_names = y.values.categories
nlabels = len(label_names)

                     group_colors=label_colors,
                     group_names=label_names)


##############################################################################
# We instantiate a :class:`~skfda.exploratory.visualization.Boxplot`
# object with the data, and we call its
# :func:`~skfda.exploratory.visualization.Boxplot.plot` function to show the
# graph.
#
# By default, only the part of the outlier curves which falls out of the
# central regions is plotted. We want the entire curve to be shown, that is
# why the ``show_full_outliers`` parameter is set to True.

# We can observe in the boxplot the median in black, the central region (where
# the 50% of the most centered samples reside) in pink and the envelopes and
# vertical lines in blue. The outliers detected, those samples with at least a
# point outside the outlying envelope, are represented with a red dashed line.
# The colors can be customized.
#
# The outliers are shown below with respect to the other samples.

##############################################################################
# The curves pointed as outliers are are those curves with significantly lower
# values than the rest. This is the expected result due to the depth measure
# used, :func:`~skfda.exploratory.depth.IntegratedDepth`, which ranks
# the samples according to their magnitude.
#
# The :class:`~skfda.exploratory.visualization.Boxplot` object admits any
# :ref:`depth measure <depth-measures>` defined or customized by the user. Now
# the call is done with the :class:`~skfda.exploratory.depth.ModifiedBandDepth`
# and the factor is reduced in order to designate some samples as outliers
# (otherwise, with this measure and the default factor, none of the curves are
# pointed out as outliers). We can see that the outliers detected belong to
# the Pacific and Arctic climates which are less common to find in Canada. As
# a consequence, this measure detects better shape outliers compared to the
# previous one.

    fd_temperatures, depth_method=ModifiedBandDepth(), factor=0.4)

##############################################################################
# Another functionality implemented in this object is the enhanced functional
# boxplot, which can include other central regions, apart from the central or
# 50% one.
#
# In the following instantiation, the
# :func:`~skfda.exploratory.depth.IntegratedDepth` is used and the 25% and
# 75% central regions are specified.

fdBoxplot = Boxplot(fd_temperatures, depth_method=IntegratedDepth(),
                    prob=[0.75, 0.5, 0.25])
fdBoxplot.plot()

##############################################################################
# The above two lines could be replaced just by fdBoxplot inside a notebook
# since the default representation of the
# :class:`~skfda.exploratory.visualization.Boxplot` is the image of the plot.
