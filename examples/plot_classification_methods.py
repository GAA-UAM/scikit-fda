Classification methods
==================================

It shows a comparison between the accuracies of different classification
methods.
There has been selected one method of each kind present in the library.
In particular, there is one based on depths, Maximum Depth Classifier,
another one based on centroids, Nearest Centroid Classifier, another one
based on the K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and
finally, one based on the quadratic discriminant analysis, Parameterized
Functional QDA.

The Berkeley Growth Study dataset is used as input data.

# The fourth method considered is a Parameterized functional quadratic
# discriminant.
# We have selected a gaussian kernel with initial parameters: variance=6 and

# results as the algorithm will automatically optimize them.
# As regularizer a small value 0.05 has been chosen.

##############################################################################
# As it can be seen, the classifier with the lowest score is the Maximum
# Depth Classifier. It obtains a 82.14% accuracy for the test set.
# KNN and Parameterized Functional QDA can be seen as the best classifiers
# for this problem, with an accuracy of 96.43%.
# Instead, the Nearest Centroid Classifier is not as good as the others.
# However, it obtains an accuracy of 85.71% for the test set.
# It can be concluded that all classifiers work well for this problem, as they
# achieve more than an 80% of score, but the most robust ones are KNN and
# Parameterized Functional QDA.

# The figure below shows the results of the classification for the test set on
# the four methods considered.
# It can be seen that the curves are similarly classified by all of them.
