##############################################################################
# In this example, we will demonstrate the use of the FPCA regression method
# using the :func:`tecator <skfda.datasets.fetch_tecator>` dataset.
# This data set contains 215 samples. Each of those samples is comprised of
# a spectrum of absorbances and the contents of water, fat and protein.

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_tecator(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
X = X.iloc[:, 0].values
y = y["fat"].values

##############################################################################
# Our goal will be to estimate the fat percentage from the spectrum. However,
# in order to better understand the data, we will first plot all the spectra
# curves. The color of these curves depends on the amount of fat, from least
# (yellow) to highest (red).

X.plot(gradient_criteria=y, legend=True)
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# In order to evaluate the performance of the model, we will split the data
# into train and test sets. The former will contain 80% of the samples, while
# the latter will contain the remaining 20%.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=1,
)

##############################################################################
# Since the FPCA regression provides good results with a small number of
# components, we will start by using only 5 components. After training the
# model, we can check its performance on the test set.

reg = FPCARegression(n_components=5)
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(reg.score(X_test, y_test))

##############################################################################
# We have obtained a pretty good result considering that
# the model has only used 5 components. That is to say, the dimensionality of
# the problem has been reduced from 100 (each spectrum has 100 points) to 5.
#
# However, we can improve the performance of the model by using more
# components. To do so, we will use cross validation to find the best number of
# components. We will test with values from 1 to 100.

param_grid = {"n_components": range(1, 100, 1)}
reg = FPCARegression()

# Perform grid search with cross-validation
gscv = GridSearchCV(reg, param_grid, cv=5)
gscv.fit(X_train, y_train)


print("Best params:", gscv.best_params_)
print("Best cross-validation score:", gscv.best_score_)

##############################################################################
# The best performance for the train set is obtained using 30 components.
# This still provides a good reduction in dimensionality. However, it is
# important to note that the performance of the model scales
# very slowly with the number of components.
#
# This phenomenon can be seen in the following plot, and confirms that
# FPCA already provides a good approximation of the data with
# a small number of components.

ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)

ax.set_xticks(range(0, 100, 10))
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Components")
ax.set_xlabel("Cross-validation score")
ax.set_ylim((0.5, 1))

##############################################################################
# To conclude, we can calculate the score of the model on the test set after
# it has been trained on the whole train set. As expected, the score is
# slightly higher than the one reported by the cross-validation.
#
# Moreover, we can check that the score barely changes when we use a somewhat
# smaller number of components.

reg = FPCARegression(n_components=30)
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Score with 30 components:", reg.score(X_test, y_test))

reg = FPCARegression(n_components=15)
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Score with 15 components:", reg.score(X_test, y_test))
