# Langevin dynamics is a mathematical model used to describe the behaviour of
# particles in a fluid, particularly in the context of statistical mechanic
# and molecular dynamics. It was initally formulated by French physicist Paul
# Langevin. In Langevin dynamics, the motion of particles is influenced by both
# determinist  and stochastic forces. The ideas presented by Paul Langevin can
# be applied in various disciplines to simulate the behaviour of particles in
# complex environments. In our case, we will use them to produce samples from
# a probability distribution: a 2-d Gaussian mixture.
#
# Langevin dynamics enable us to sample from probability distributions from
# which a non-normalised pdf is known. This is possible thanks to the use
# of the score function. Given a probability density function
# :math:`p(\mathbf{x}),` the score function is defined as the gradient of its
# logarithm
#
# .. math::
#
#   \nabla_\mathbf{x} \log p(\mathbf{x}).
#
# For example, if :math:`p(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q(\mathbf{x})}{Z}`, where
# :math:`q(\mathbf{x}) \geq 0` is known but :math:`Z` is a not known
# normalising constant, then the score of :math:`p` is
#
# .. math::
#
#   \nabla_\mathbf{x} \log p(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla_\mathbf{x} \log q(\mathbf{x})
#   - \nabla_\mathbf{x} \log Z =  \nabla_\mathbf{x} \log q(\mathbf{x}),
#
# which is known.
#
# Once we know the score function, we can sample from the
# probability distribution :math:`p(\mathbf{x})` using a dynamic driven by
# SDEs. The idea is to define an SDE whose stationary distribution is
# :math:`p(\mathbf{x})`. If we evolve the SDE
#
# .. math::
#
#   d\mathbf{X}(t) = \nabla_\mathbf{x} \log p(\mathbf{X}(t))dt +
#   \sqrt{2}d\mathbf{W}(t)
#
# from an arbitrary, sufficiently smooth initial distribution
# :math:`\mathbf{X}(0) \sim \pi_0(\mathbf{x})`, we get that for
# :math:`t \rightarrow \infty`, the marginal probability distribution of the
# process converges to the distribution :math:`p(\mathbf{x})`. The initial
# distribution :math:`\pi_0(\mathbf{x})` could be any sufficiently smooth
# distribution.
#
# We will use scikit-fda to simulate this process. We will exemplify this
# use case by sampling from a 2-d Gaussian mixture, but the same steps can be
# applied to other distributions.
#
# We will start by defining some notation. The Gaussian mixture is composed
# of :math:`N` Gaussians of mean :math:`\mu_n` and covariance matrix
# :math:`\Sigma_n`. For the sake of simplicity, we will suppose the covariance
# matrices are diagonal. Let :math:`\sigma_n` then be the corresponding vector
# of standard deviations. Each Gaussian will be weighted by :math:`\omega_n`,
# such that :math:`\sum_{n=1}^N \omega_n = 1`. So, if :math:`p_n(x)` is the pdf
# for the n-th Gaussian, then the pdf of the mixture is
# :math:`p(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\omega_n p_n(x)`.
#
# To compute the score, we can use the chain rule:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \nabla_x \log p(x) =  \frac{\nabla_x p(x)}{p(x)} =
#   \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N}\omega_n\nabla_x p_n(x)}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}\omega_n p_n(x)}
#   = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N}\omega_n p_n(x) \frac{x - \mu_n}{\sigma_n}}
#   {\sum_{n=1}^{N}\omega_n p_n(x)}.
#
# We start by defining functions that compute the pdf, log_pdf and score of the
# distribution.

# As we can see in the image, the score function is a vector which points
# in the direction in which :math:`\log p(\mathbf{x})` grows faster. Also, if
# :math:`\mathbf{X}(t)` is in an low probability region,
# :math:`\nabla_\mathbf{x} \log p(\mathbf{X}(t))` will have a big norm, which
# means that points which are far away from the "common" areas will tend
# faster towards more probable ones. In regions with high probability,
# :math:`\nabla_\mathbf{x} \log p(\mathbf{X}(t))` will have a small norm,
# which means that the majority of the samples will remain in that area.

# We can now proceed to define the parameters for the SDE simulation. For
# this example we have chosen than the starting data follow a uniform
# distribution, but any other distribution is equally valid.
