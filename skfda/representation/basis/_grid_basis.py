class _GridBasis(Basis):
    """
    Basis associated to a grid of points.

    Used to express functions whose values are known in a grid of points.
    Each basis function is guaranteed to be zero in all points of the grid
    except one, where it is one. The intermediate values are interpolated
    depending on the interpolation object passed as argument.

    This basis is used internally as an alternate representation of a
    FDataGrid object. In certain cases, it is more convenient to work with
    FDataGrid objects as a basis representation in this basis since, then,
    all functional data can be represented as an FDataBasis object.

    Parameters:
        grid_points: Grid of points where the functions are evaluated.
