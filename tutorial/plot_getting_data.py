Getting the data
================

In this section, we will dicuss how to get functional data to
use in scikit-fda. We will briefly describe the
:class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` class, which is the type that
scikit-fda uses for storing and working with functional data in discretized
form. We will discuss also how to import functional data from several sources
and show how to fetch and load existing datasets popular in the :term:`FDA`
literature.

# %%
# The FDataGrid class
# -------------------
#
# In order to use scikit-fda, first we need functional data to analyze.
# A common case is to have each functional observation measured at the same
# points.
# This kind of functional data is easily representable in scikit-fda using
# the :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` class.
# The :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` has two important
# attributes: ``data_matrix`` and ``grid_points``.
#
# The attribute ``grid_points`` is a tuple with the same length as the
# number of domain dimensions (that is, one for curves, two for surfaces...).
# Each of its elements is a 1D numpy :class:`~numpy.ndarray` containing the
# grid points for that particular dimension,
#
# .. math::
#     ((t_{i 1}, \ldots, t_{i M_i}))_{i=1}^p,
#
# where :math:`M_i` is the number of measurement points for each "argument"
# or domain coordinate of the function :math:`i` and :math:`p` is the domain
# dimension.
#
# The attribute ``data_matrix`` is a
# numpy :class:`~numpy.ndarray` containing the measured values of the
# functions in the grid spanned by the grid points. For functions
# :math:`\{x_n: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^q\}_{n=1}^N` this is a tensor
# with dimensions :math:`N \times M_1 \times \ldots \times M_p \times q`.

# %%
# In order to create a :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid`, these
# attributes may be provided. The attributes are converted to
# :class:`~numpy.ndarray` when necessary.
#
# .. note::
#     The grid points can be omitted,
#     and in that case their number is inferred from the dimensions of
#     ``data_matrix`` and they are automatically assigned as equispaced points
#     in the unitary cube in the domain set.
#
#     In the common case of functions with domain dimension of 1, the list of
#     grid points can be passed directly as ``grid_points``.
#
#     If the codomain dimension is 1, the last dimension of ``data_matrix``
#     can be dropped.

# %%
# The following example shows the creation of a
# :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` with two functions (curves)
# :math:`\{x_i: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\}, i=1,2` measured at the same
# (non-equispaced) points.

import skfda
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

grid_points = np.array([0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 1])  # Grid points of the curves
data_matrix = np.array([
    [0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 1],     # First observation
    [0, 0.04, 0.25, 0.81, 1],  # Second observation
])

fd = skfda.FDataGrid(
    data_matrix=data_matrix,
    grid_points=grid_points,
)

fd.plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# Advanced example
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In order to better understand the FDataGrid structure, you can consider the
# following example, in which a :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid`
# object is created, containing just one function (vector-valued surface)
# :math:`x: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^4`.


grid_points_surface = [
    np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.7]),   # Measurement points in first domain dimension
    np.array([0, 1.5]),          # Measurement points in second domain dimension
]

data_matrix_surface = np.array([
    # First observation
    [
        # 0.2
        [
            # Value at (0.2, 0)
            [1, 2, 3, 4.1],
            # Value at (0.2, 1.5)
            [0, 1, -1.3, 2],
        ],
        # 0.5
        [
            # Value at (0.5, 0)
            [-2, 0, 5.5, 7],
            # Value at (0.5, 1.5)
            [2, 1.1, -1, -2],
        ],
        # 0.7
        [
            # Value at (0.7, 0)
            [0, 0, 1.1, 1],
            # Value at (0.7, 1.5)
            [-3, 5, -0.5, -2],
        ],
    ],
    # This example has only one observation. Next observations would be
    # added here.
])

fd = skfda.FDataGrid(
    data_matrix=data_matrix_surface,
    grid_points=grid_points_surface,
)

plt.show()

# %%
# Importing data
# --------------
#
# Usually the data used in the analysis comes from previous measurements of
# an experiment, that have been stored in some file format, such as
# comma-separated values (CSV), attribute-relation file format (ARFF) or
# Matlab and R formats.
# Users should know the particular layout used for representing functional data
# on their files, as there is currently no standard format for storing this
# kind of data.

# %%
# .. note::
#     scikit-fda does not offer input/output functions right now.
#     You can parse the grid points and values of the functions using the
#     available tools in the Scientific Python ecosystem:
#
#     * `Numpy <https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.io.html>`_:
#       for simple text-based or binary formats, such as CSV.
#     * `Scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/io.html>`_:
#       for Matlab, Fortran or ARFF files.
#     * `RData <https://rdata.readthedocs.io>`_: for loading data in the
#       R file formats.
#     * `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html>`_:
#       includes tools for reading a variety of file formats, such as CSV,
#       JSON, HTML, LaTeX, XML, Excel, HDF5, Parquet, SPSS or SQL.
#
#     Once the data is loaded as NumPy arrays, you can construct the
#     :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` as explained above.

# %%
# For example, consider the following file, containing unidimensional
# functional data in CSV form.
# The first row (the header) contains the grid points, common for all
# observations.
# Each of the following rows is a functional observation.

import pathlib
import textwrap

file_content = textwrap.dedent(
    """\
    0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0
    109.5, 115.8, 121.9, 130.0, 138.2, 141.1
    104.6, 112.3, 118.9, 125.0, 130.1, 133.0
    100.4, 107.1, 112.3, 118.6, 124.0, 126.5
    """,
)

test_file = pathlib.Path("data.csv")
test_file.write_text(file_content)
text = test_file.read_text()
print(text)

# %%
# We can now load the CSV using the functions in Pandas.
# Note that by default, Pandas reads the header as text and uses it to name
# the columns.
# Thus, we need to convert it to float before we can pass it to the
# :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` constructor.

import pandas

data = pandas.read_csv("data.csv")

grid_points = data.columns.astype(float).to_numpy()
data_matrix = data.to_numpy()

# %%
# We can now construct the :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid`
# as before and plot it:

fd = skfda.FDataGrid(
    data_matrix=data_matrix,
    grid_points=grid_points,
)

fd.plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# If you have data that is already a NumPy array, you can use it directly.
# For example, we will load the
# :func:`digits dataset <sklearn.datasets.load_digits>` of scikit-learn, which
# is a preprocessed subset of the MNIST dataset, containing digit images.
# The data is already a NumPy array. As the data has been flattened into a 1D
# vector of pixels, we need to reshape the arrays to their original 8x8 shape.
# Then this array can be used to construct the digits as surfaces.

from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

X, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)
X = X.reshape(-1, 8, 8)

fd = skfda.FDataGrid(X)

# Plot the first 2 observations
fd[0].plot()
fd[1].plot()
plt.show()


# %%
# Common datasets
# ---------------
#
# scikit-fda can download and import for you several of the most popular
# datasets in the :term:`FDA` literature, such as the Berkeley Growth
# dataset (function :func:`~skfda.datasets.fetch_growth`) or the Canadian
# Weather dataset (function :func:`~skfda.datasets.fetch_weather`). These
# datasets are often useful as benchmarks, in order to compare results
# between different algorithms, or simply as examples to use in teaching or
# research.

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_growth(return_X_y=True)

X.plot(group=y)
plt.show()

# %%
# Datasets from CRAN
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If you want to work with a dataset for which no fetching function exist, and
# you know that is available inside a R package in the CRAN repository, you
# can try using the function :func:`~skfda.datasets.fetch_cran`. This function
# will load the package, fetch the dataset and convert it to Python objects
# using the packages
# `scikit-datasets <https://github.com/daviddiazvico/scikit-datasets>`_ and
# `RData <https://rdata.readthedocs.io>`_. As datasets in CRAN follow no
# particular structure, you will need to know how it is structured internally
# in order to use it properly.

# %%
# .. note::
#     Functional data objects from some packages, such as
#     `fda.usc <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda.usc/index.html>`_
#     are automatically recognized as such and converted to
#     :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` instances. This
#     behaviour can be disabled or customized to work with more packages.

data = skfda.datasets.fetch_cran("MCO", "fda.usc")

data["MCO"]["intact"].plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# Datasets from the UEA & UCR Time Series Classification Repository
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The `UEA & UCR Time Series Classification Repository
# <http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/>`_ is a popular repository
# for classification problems involving time series data. The datasets used
# can be considered also as functional observations, where the functions
# involved have domain dimension of 1, and the grid points are
# equispaced. Thus, they have also been used in the :term:`FDA` literature.
# The original UCR datasets are univariate time series, while the new UEA
# datasets incorporate also vector-valued data.
# In scikit-fda, the function :func:`~skfda.datasets.fetch_ucr` can be used
# to obtain both kinds of datasets as
# :class:`~skfda.representation.grid.FDataGrid` instances.

# Load ArrowHead dataset from UCR
dataset = skfda.datasets.fetch_ucr("ArrowHead")
dataset["data"].plot()
plt.show()

# %%

# Load BasicMotions dataset from UEA
dataset = skfda.datasets.fetch_ucr("BasicMotions")
dataset["data"].plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# Synthetic data
# --------------
#
# Sometimes it is not enough to have real-world data at your disposal.
# Perhaps the messy nature of real-world data makes difficult to detect when
# a particular algorithm has a strange behaviour. Perhaps you want to see how
# it performs under a simplified model. Maybe you want to see what happens
# when your data has particular characteristics, for which no dataset is
# available. Or maybe you only want to illustrate a concept without having
# to introduce a particular set of data.
#
# In those cases, the ability to use generated data is desirable. To aid this
# use case, scikit-learn provides several functions that generate data
# according to some model. These functions are in the
# :doc:`datasets </modules/datasets>` module and have the prefix ``make_``.
# Maybe the most useful of those are the functions
# :func:`skfda.datasets.make_gaussian_process` and
# :func:`skfda.datasets.make_gaussian` which can be used to generate Gaussian
# processes and Gaussian fields with different covariance functions.

cov = skfda.misc.covariances.Exponential(length_scale=0.1)

fd = skfda.datasets.make_gaussian_process(
    start=0,
    stop=4,
    n_samples=5,
    n_features=100,
    mean=lambda t: t**2,
    cov=cov,
)

fd.plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# In order to know all the available functionalities to load existing and
# synthetic datasets it is recommended to look at the documentation of the
# :doc:`datasets </modules/datasets>` module.
