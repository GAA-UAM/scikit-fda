Introduction
============

In this section, we will briefly explain what is
:term:`functional data analysis (FDA) <FDA>`, and we will introduce
scikit-fda, a library that provides FDA tools to staticians, engineers or
machine learning practicioners in the Python scientific ecosystem.

# What is functional data analysis?
# ---------------------------------
#
# Traditional multivariate statistics focus on the simultaneous analysis of
# a finite number of variables. In this setting, we have several observations,
# each of them consisting on a vector of measured values. The variables, or
# coordinates of this vector, could be correlated, but otherwise they can be
# arbitrarily ordered inside the observed vector, provided that the order is
# the same for each observation. Usually these observations are considered
# to be instances of a random vector, and a big part of the analysis is
# centered in finding the distribution associated with it.
#
# In contrast, in functional data analysis each observation is a function of
# one or several variables, such as curves or surfaces. These functions are
# usually continuous and often they are smooth, and derivatives can be
# computed. The number of variables of these objects is then infinite, as each
# evaluation of the function at one point could be considered as one variable.
# Moreover, now it is not possible to reorder the variables of the
# observations without altering substantially its structure. If the functions
# are continuous, nearby variables are highly correlated, a characteristic
# that makes some classical multivariate methods unsuitable to work with this
# data.
#
# In this setting, observations can also be considered to be instances
# of a "functional random variable", usually called a stochastic process or
# a random field. However, some of the concepts that proved very useful to
# analyze multivariate data, such as density functions, are not applicable
# to :term:`functional data`, while new tools, such as taking derivatives,
# become available.
#
# As such, functional data can benefit of a separate analysis from
# multivariate statistics, but also adapting and extending multivariate
# techniques when possible.

# %%
# What is scikit-fda?
# -------------------
#
# scikit-fda is a Python library containing classes and functions that allow
# you to perform functional data analysis tasks. Using it you can:
#
#     - Represent functions as Python objects, both in a discretized fashion
#       and as a basis expansion.
#     - Apply preprocessing methods to functional data, including smoothing,
#       registration and dimensionality reduction.
#     - Perform a complete exploratory analysis of the data, summarizing its
#       main properties, detecting possible outliers and visualizing the data
#       in several ways.
#     - Apply statistical inference tools developed for functional data, such
#       as functional ANOVA.
#     - Perform usual machine learning tasks, such as classification,
#       regression or clustering, using functional observations.
#     - Combine the tools offered by scikit-fda with other tools of the Python
#       scientific ecosystem, such as those provided by the popular machine
#       learning library `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_.

# Anatomy of a function
# ---------------------
#
# We would like to briefly remind the reader the basic concepts that are
# employed to talk about functions. Functions in math are a relation between
# two sets, the :term:`domain` and the :term:`codomain` in which each element
# of the :term:`domain` is restricted to be related to exactly one element of
# the :term:`codomain`. The intuition behind this is that a function
# represents some type of deterministic process, that takes elements of the
# :term:`domain` as inputs and produces elements of the :term:`codomain` as
# outputs.
#
# In :term:`FDA`, the inputs or parameters of a function are assumed to be
# continuous parameters, and so are the outputs, or values of the function.
# Thus, it is usual to restrict our functional observations to be functions
# :math:`\{x_i: \mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^q\}_{i=1}^N`.
# In this case both the domain and codomain are (subsets of) vector spaces of
# real numbers, and one could talk of the dimension of each of them as a
# vector space (in this case the domain dimension is :math:`p` and the
# codomain dimension is :math:`q`).
#
# The most common case of functional observation, and the one that has
# received more attention in the functional data literature, is the case of
# functions
# :math:`\{x_i: \mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\}_{i=1}^N`
# (curves or trajectories).

# %%
# As an example, the following code shows the Berkeley Growth dataset, one
# of the classical datasets used in :term:`FDA`. The curves are heights of
# 93 boys and girls measured at several points since their birth to
# their 18th birthday. Here the domain :math:`\mathcal{T}` is the interval
# :math:`[0, 18]` and both the domain and codomain have a dimension of one.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import skfda

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_growth(return_X_y=True)

X.plot()
plt.show()

# %%
# Functions where the domain dimension is greater than one (
# such as surfaces or higher dimensional objects) are referred to as functions
# of several variables. Functions where the codomain dimension is greater than
# one are called vector-valued functions.

# %%
# As an example we show another popular dataset: Canadian Weather. Here each
# observation correspond to data taken from a different weather station in
# Canada. For each day of the year we have two values: the average temperature
# at that day among several years and the average precipitation among the same
# years. Thus, here the domain :math:`\mathcal{T}` is the interval
# :math:`[0, 365)`, the domain dimension is one and the codomain dimension
# is two. We can see that by default each coordinate of the values of the
# function is plotted as a separate coordinate function.

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_weather(return_X_y=True)

X.plot()
plt.show()
