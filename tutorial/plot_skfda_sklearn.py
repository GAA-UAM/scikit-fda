Scikit-fda and scikit-learn
===========================

In this section, we will explain how scikit-fda interacts  with the popular
machine learning package scikit-learn. We will introduce briefly the main
concepts of scikit-learn and how scikit-fda reuses the same concepts extending
them to the :term:`functional data analysis` field.

# A brief summary of scikit-learn architecture
# --------------------------------------------
#
# The library `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_ is probably the most
# well-known Python package for machine learning. This package focuses in
# machine learning using multivariate data, which should be stored in a numpy
# :class:`~numpy.ndarray` in order to process it. However, this library has
# defined a particular architecture that can be followed in order to provide
# new tools that work in situations not even imagined by the original authors,
# while remaining compatible with the tools already provided in scikit-learn.
#
# In scikit-fda, the same architecture is applied in order to work with
# functional data observations. As a result, scikit-fda tools are
# largely compatible with scikit-learn tools, and it is possible to reuse
# objects such as :class:`pipelines <sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline>` or even
# hyperparameter selection methods such as
# :class:`grid search cross-validation <sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV>`
# in the functional data setting.
#
# We will introduce briefly the main concepts in scikit-learn, and explain how
# the tools in scikit-fda are related with them. This is not intended as a full
# explanation of scikit-learn architecture, and the reader is encouraged to
# look at the `scikit-learn tutorials
# <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html>`_ in order to achieve
# a deeper understanding of it.

##############################################################################
# The Estimator object
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# A central concept in scikit-learn (and scikit-fda) is what is called an
# estimator. An estimator in this context is an object that can learn from
# the data. Thus, classification, regression and clustering methods, as well
# as transformations with parameters learned from the training data are
# particular kinds of estimators. Estimators can also be instanced passing
# parameters, which can be tuned to the data using hyperparameter selection
# methods.
#
# Estimator objects have a ``fit`` method, with receive the training data
# and (if necessary) the training targets. This method uses the training data
# in order to learn some parameters of a model. When the learned parameters
# are part of the user-facing API, then by convention they are attributes of
# the estimator ending in with the ``_`` character.

##############################################################################
# As a concrete example of this, consider a nearest centroid classifier
# for functional data. The object
# :class:`~skfda.ml.classification.NearestCentroid` is a classifier, and
# thus an estimator. As part of the training process the centroids of
# the classes are computed and available as the learned parameter
# ``centroids_``.
#
# .. note::
#     The function :func:`~sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` is
#     one of the functions originally from scikit-learn that can be
#     directly reused in scikit-fda.

import skfda
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_growth(return_X_y=True)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

classifier = skfda.ml.classification.NearestCentroid()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
classifier.centroids_.plot()
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# Transformers
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# :term:`Transformers <sklearn:transformers>` are estimators which can convert
# data to a new form. Examples of them are preprocessing methods, such as
# smoothing, registration and dimensionality reduction methods. They always
# implement ``fit_transform`` for fitting and transforming the data in one
# step. The transformers may be :term:`sklearn:inductive`, which means that
# can transform new data using the learned parameters. In that case they
# implement the ``transform`` method to transform new data. If the
# transformation is reversible, they usually also implement
# ``ìnverse_transform``.

##############################################################################
# As an example consider the smoothing method
# :class:`skfda.preprocessing.smoothing.NadarayaWatsonHatMatrix`. Smoothing
# methods attempt to remove noise from the data leveraging its continuous
# nature.
# As these methods discard information of the original data they usually are
# not reversible.

import skfda.preprocessing.smoothing as ks
from skfda.misc.hat_matrix import NadarayaWatsonHatMatrix
X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_phoneme(return_X_y=True)

# Keep the first 5 functions
X = X[:5]

X.plot()

smoother = ks.KernelSmoother(kernel_estimator=NadarayaWatsonHatMatrix())
X_smooth = smoother.fit_transform(X)

X_smooth.plot()
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# Predictors (classifiers, regressors, clusterers...)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# :term:`Predictors <sklearn:predictor>` in scikit-learn are estimators that
# can assign a certain target to a particular observation. This includes
# supervised methods such as classifiers (for which the target will be a class
# label), or regressors (for which the target is a real value, a vector, or,
# in functional data analysis, even a function!) and also unsupervised methods
# such as clusterers or outlying detector methods.
#
# Predictors should implement the ``fit_predict`` method for fitting the
# estimators and predicting the targets in one step and/or the ``predict``
# method for predicting the targets of possibly non previously observed data.
# Usually :term:`sklearn:transductive` estimators implement only the former
# one, while :term:`sklearn:inductive` estimators implement the latter one (or
# both).
#
# Predictors can have additional non-mandatory methods, such as
# ``predict-proba`` for obtaining the probability of a particular prediction
# or ``score`` for evaluating the results of the prediction.

##############################################################################
# As an example, we can look at the :class:`~skfda.ml.clustering.KMeans`
# clustering method for functional data. This method will try to separate
# the data into different clusters according to the distance between
# observations.

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_weather(return_X_y=True)

# Use only the first value (temperature)
X = X.coordinates[0]

clusterer = skfda.ml.clustering.KMeans(n_clusters=3)
y_pred = clusterer.fit_predict(X)

X.plot(group=y_pred)
plt.show()

##############################################################################
# Metaestimators
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In scikit-learn jargon, a :term:`sklearn:metaestimator` is an estimator
# that takes other estimators as parameters. There are several reasons for
# doing that, which will be explained now.

##############################################################################
# Composition metaestimators
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# It is very common in machine learning to apply one or more preprocessing
# steps one after the other, before applying a final predictor. For this
# purpose scikit-learn offers the :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`, which
# join the steps together and uses the same estimator API for performing all
# steps in order (this is usually referred as the composite pattern in
# software engineering). The :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` estimator
# can be used with the functional data estimators available in scikit-fda.
# Moreover, as transformers such as dimensionality reduction methods can
# convert functional data to multivariate data usable by scikit-learn methods
# it is possible to mix methods from scikit-fda and scikit-learn in the same
# pipeline.
#
# .. warning::
#     In addition, scikit-learn offers estimators that can join several
#     transformations as new features of the same dataset (
#     :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion`) or that can apply different
#     transformers to different columns of the data
#     (:class:`~sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`). These transformers
#     are not yet usable with functional data.

##############################################################################
# As an example, we can construct a pipeline that registers the data using
# shift registation, then applies a variable selection method to
# transform each observation to a 3D vector and then uses a SVM classifier
# to classify the data.

from skfda.preprocessing.dim_reduction import variable_selection as vs
from skfda.preprocessing.registration import LeastSquaresShiftRegistration
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_growth(return_X_y=True)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("registration", LeastSquaresShiftRegistration()),
    ("dim_reduction", vs.RKHSVariableSelection(n_features_to_select=3)),
    ("classifier", SVC()),
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)

##############################################################################
# Hyperparameter optimizers
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# Some of the parameters used for the creation of an estimator need to be
# tuned to each particular dataset in order to improve the prediction accuracy
# and generalization. There are several techniques to do that already
# available in scikit-learn, such as grid search cross-validation
# (:class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`) or randomized search
# (:class:`~sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`). As these
# hyperparameter optimizers only need to split the data and call ``score`` in
# the predictor, they can be directly used with the methods in scikit-fda.
#
# .. note::
#     In addition one could use any optimizer that understand the scikit-learn
#     API such as those in `scikit-optimize
#     <https://scikit-optimize.github.io>`_.

##############################################################################
# As an example, we will use :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`
# to select the number of neighbors used in a
# :class:`~skfda.ml.classification.KNeighborsClassifier`.

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_growth(return_X_y=True)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

classifier = skfda.ml.classification.KNeighborsClassifier()

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=classifier,
    param_grid={"n_neighbors": range(1, 10, 2)},
)

grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
n_neighbors = grid_search.best_estimator_.n_neighbors
score = grid_search.score(X_test, y_test)

print(n_neighbors, score)

##############################################################################
# Ensemble methods
# ++++++++++++++++
#
# The ensemble methods :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier` and
# :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.VotingRegressor` in scikit-learn use several
# different estimators in order to predict the targets. As this is done
# by evaluating the passed estimators as black boxes, these predictors can
# also be combined with scikit-fda predictors.
#
# .. warning::
#     Other ensemble methods, such as
#     :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier` or
#     :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier` cannot yet
#     be used with functional data unless it has been
#     transformed to a multivariate dataset.

##############################################################################
# As an example we will use a voting classifier to classify data using as
# classifiers a knn-classifier, a nearest centroid classifier and a
# maximum depth classifier.

from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_growth(return_X_y=True)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

knn = skfda.ml.classification.KNeighborsClassifier()
nearest_centroid = skfda.ml.classification.NearestCentroid()
mdc = skfda.ml.classification.MaximumDepthClassifier()

voting = VotingClassifier([
    ("knn", knn),
    ("nearest_centroid", nearest_centroid),
    ("mdc", mdc),
])

voting.fit(X_train, y_train)
voting.score(X_test, y_test)

##############################################################################
# Multiclass and multioutput classification utilities
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# The scikit-learn library also offers additional utilities that can convert
# a binary classifier into a multiclass classifier (such as
# :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`) or to extend a single
# output classifier or regressor to accept also multioutput (vector-valued)
# targets.

##############################################################################
# In this example we want to use as a classifier the combination of a
# dimensionality reduction method (
# :class:`~skfda.preprocessing.dim_reduction.variable_selection.RKHSVariableSelection`)
# and a SVM classifier (:class:`~sklearn.svm.SVC`). As that particular
# dimensionality reduction method is only suitable for binary data, we use
# :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier` to classify in a
# multiclass dataset.

from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier

X, y = skfda.datasets.fetch_phoneme(return_X_y=True)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("dim_reduction", vs.RKHSVariableSelection(n_features_to_select=3)),
    ("classifier", SVC()),
])

multiclass = OneVsRestClassifier(pipeline)

multiclass.fit(X_train, y_train)
multiclass.score(X_test, y_test)

##############################################################################
# Other scikit-learn utilities
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In addition to the aforementioned objects, there are plenty of objects in
# scikit-learn that can be applied directly to functional data. We have
# already seen in the examples the function
# :func:`~sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`. Other objects and
# functions such as :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.KFold` can be directly
# applied to functional data in order to split it into folds. Scorers for
# classification or regression, such as
# :func:`~sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score` can be directly applied to
# functional data problems.
#
# Moreover, there are plenty of libraries that aim to extend scikit-learn in
# several directions (take a look at the `list of related projects
# <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/related_projects.html>`_). You will
# probably see that a lot of the functionality can be applied to scikit-fda,
# as it uses the same API as scikit-learn.
